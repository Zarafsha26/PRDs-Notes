# PRDs-Notes
- A Product Requirements Document (PRD) provides comprehensive information about system functionality. Typically used in the field of software engineering, though also applicable to other disciplines, a PRD ensures that everyone involved in the development process—be it product managers, designers, developers, or testers—is aligned on what's being built and why.

- Here's a step-by-step guide on how to write a PRD:

# Title and Introduction:
- Start with a brief, descriptive title for the feature/product. Follow with a concise introduction to provide context about what this PRD covers.

## Purpose and Goal:
- Clearly state why this product or feature is necessary. Answer the questions: What problem does it solve? Who benefits from this solution?

## Stakeholders: 
- List all the people or teams who will have an interest in the product or feature, from development to marketing to customer support.

# Features and Requirements:

## Functional Requirements:
- List and detail the features the product/feature will have. Describe what the system should do.
## Non-Functional Requirements: 
- Describe how the system should behave. This could include performance standards, security considerations, or user experience details.
Use Cases: Illustrate how a user will interact with the system. Describe the flow and steps the user will take.

# User Flow and Design:

- Sketch or provide mockups of the user interface. This helps visualize how the user will navigate and interact.
- Include any design principles or standards that need to be adhered to.
## Dependencies: 
- Specify any other products, systems, or features this product might depend on. This could include external software, third-party services, or internal systems.

## Constraints:
- List any limitations or restrictions. This could be technical constraints, budgetary restrictions, or time constraints.

## Metrics & Analytics: 
- Specify what will be measured to determine the success of the product. How will you know if the product is successful or not?

## Timeline: 
- Offer a tentative timeline with milestones. When should a prototype be ready? When is the launch?

## Appendices:
-This can include any additional information that's relevant, such as research data, competitor analysis, or reference links.

## Feedback and Revision: 
- After drafting, share the PRD with relevant stakeholders. Collect feedback, and revise as necessary.
